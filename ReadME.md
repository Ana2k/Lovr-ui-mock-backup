# MONADO IMMERSIVE DASHBOARD - An XROS Project 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## How should we run the dashboard on personal system?

 - This is the entire dashboard that was created during the XROS journey.
 - To start the app run 'monado-service'
 - Then using a fresh terminal run the main.lua file using the command ./lovr_app_image /path_to_main.lua_file
   (The app image used to create this dashboard can be downloaded from https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr/releases/tag/v0.16.0)
 - Monado can be downloaded and ran from the https://monado.freedesktop.org/getting-started.html
 - Can refer to this doc for more information (https://monado.freedesktop.org/getting-started.html)

## How does the dashboard look like for now?
  <table>
<tr>
  <td><img width="680" height ="420" src= "https://github.com/Ana2k/Lovr-ui-mock-backup/assets/54909114/ebf7439e-9367-47d4-8fbc-d876d77fc952" >
  </td>
Kind of like this. 
</table>

## What is the dashboard doing currently?
- It is capable of fetching information from the example.lua showing the same on the dashboard
- This information comprises :
      -   the states of the devices.
       - The name of the devices.
        - The number of clients connected to monado.
- This also includes, connecting and fetching all information using the monado system. 
- The states of the devices can be seen as png assets. (The layout.svg file is included and can be opened using inkscape.)

## What can the dashboard further do?

- At the end we were working on interactivity and toggling the actual states from within the dashboard.
- So these are the parts that can be tinkered around with or improved.
- We also hit a Huge Wall on the UI front. So for finer UI usage, we could remake using this template in chui. (https://github.com/lambdaisland/chui)
